# GUI with Java

This project demonstrates a simple graphical user interface created with Java Swing.

## Features

- Text box to enter the user's name
- Button to show a personalized greeting
- Uses basic Swing components: `JFrame`, `JTextField`, `JButton`, `JLabel`

## Improvement Ideas

Here are some ways to enhance and expand this Java GUI project:

- Add multiple input fields (e.g., last name, email) and validate user input.
- Include different Swing components such as checkboxes, radio buttons, and combo boxes for more interaction.
- Implement form submission that summarizes input data or saves it to a file.
- Add more buttons for actions like form reset or cancel.
- Use layout managers (e.g., GridBagLayout, BoxLayout) to create a flexible and responsive interface.
- Add menu bars (`JMenuBar`) or toolbars for advanced navigation options.
- Include input formatting and restrictions with `JFormattedTextField`.
- Implement multi-window navigation (e.g., open dialogs or secondary windows on events).
- Improve the UI with custom fonts, colors, tooltips, and icons.
- Add localization support to make the interface available in multiple languages.
- Include error handling and user-friendly validation messages.
